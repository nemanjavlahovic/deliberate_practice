## NSView
- Setting the value of `view.wantsLayer` property to true turns the view into a layer-backed viewâ€”that is, the view uses a CALayer object to manage its rendered content. Creating a layer-backed view implicitly causes the entire view hierarchy under that view to become layer-backed. Thus, the view and all of its subviews (including subviews of subviews) become layer-backed. The default value of this property is false.
