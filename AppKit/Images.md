### Images

- Coming from iOS, you'll be familiar with `UIImage`, and conveniently, there is a corresponding `NSImage` class in AppKit. But you'll quickly notice that these classes are vastly different. `NSImage` is, in many ways, a more powerful class than `UIImage`, but this comes at the cost of increased complexity. 
- Apple's [Cocoa Drawing Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaDrawingGuide/Images/Images.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003290-CH208-BCIBBFGJ) has a good introduction of how to work with images in AppKit.
