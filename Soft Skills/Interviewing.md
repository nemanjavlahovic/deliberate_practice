### Interviewing

## Interviewing for a job - questions for engineering manager/team lead
- When was the last time you promoted someone on your team? How did it happen?
Why: It's highly likely your experience will be similar when you ask for a promotion yourself under this person. So make sure their answer is something you'd be happy to live out.

- Why did the last person in this role leave?
Why: Unless this is a new position, the reason that someone left can be very telling. Worst case: they quit because of a toxic workplace. Best case: they were promoted up, meaning this role can lead to similar opportunities for you.
