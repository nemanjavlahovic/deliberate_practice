### Interviewing

## Interviewing for a job - questions for engineering manager/team lead
- When was the last time you promoted someone on your team? How did it happen?
Why: It's highly likely your experience will be similar when you ask for a promotion yourself under this person. So make sure their answer is something you'd be happy to live out.

- Why did the last person in this role leave?
Why: Unless this is a new position, the reason that someone left can be very telling. Worst case: they quit because of a toxic workplace. Best case: they were promoted up, meaning this role can lead to similar opportunities for you.

- How do you nurture psychological safety in your team?
Why: The workplace may be challenging, but it should never be threatening. A manager who intentionally fosters a sense of acceptance and respect can be the reason you love your job.

- When was the last time you supported a direct report's growth, even if it meant leaving your team or company?
Why: A supportive manager cares about your goals, not gluing you to your seat. The very best managers realize when it's time to move you up.

- What people in the organisation do besides work?
