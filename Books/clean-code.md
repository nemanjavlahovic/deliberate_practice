### Meaningful Names
- For example, hp, aix and sco would be poor variable names because they are the names of Unix platforms or variants. Even if you are coding a hypotenuse and hp looks like a good abbreviation, it could be disinformative.
- Noise words are another meaningless distinction. Imagine that you have a `Product` class. If you have another called `ProductInfo` or `ProductData`, you have made the names different without making them mean anything different. `Info` and `Data` are indistinct noise words like `a`, `and` and `the`.
- Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.
